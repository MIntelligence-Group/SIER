Dataset Access
--------------
Access to the ‘IIT Roorkee Speech and Image Emotion Recognition (IIT-R SIER) dataset’ can be obtained by through [`Access Form - IIT-R SIER Dataset.pdf`][2]. The dataset is prepared by Puneet Kumar and Sarthak Malik at Machine Intelligence Lab, IIT Roorkee under the supervision of Prof. Balasubramanian Raman. It contains speech utterances, corresponding images and emotion labels (happy, sad, hate, anger).
